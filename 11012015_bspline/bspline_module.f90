!# Description
!
!  Multidimensional (2D-6D) B-Spline interpolation of data on a regular grid.
!  This module uses both the subroutine and object-oriented modules.
!
!# iflag Codes
!
! The following are the `iflag` codes that can be issued by the various
! routines. They are divided into the initialize routines 
! (e.g., [[db1ink]], [[db2ink]], etc.)
! and the evaluate routines (e.g., [[db1val]], [[db2val]], etc.).
!
!## Initialize Routines
!```
!db*ink    1: successful execution.

!          3: nx out of range
!          4: kx out of range
!          5: x not strictly increasing
!          6: tx not non-decreasing
!          7: ny out of range
!          8: ky out of range
!          9: y not strictly increasing
!         10: ty not non-decreasing
!         11: nz out of range
!         12: kz out of range

!         20: kr out of range
!         21: r not strictly increasing
!         22: tr not non-decreasing

!dbintk  100: k does not satisfy k>=1
!        101: n does not satisfy n>=k
!        102: x(i) does not satisfy x(i)<x(i+1) for some i
!        103: some abscissa was not in the support of the
!             corresponding basis function and the system is singular
!        104: the system of solver detects a singular system
!             although the theoretical conditions for a solution were satisfied
!
!dbspvn  201: k does not satisfy k>=1
!        202: jhigh does not satisfy 1<=jhigh<=k
!        203: index is not 1 or 2
!        204: x does not satisfy t(ileft)<=x<=t(ileft+1)
!        
!dbtpcf  301: n should be >0

!db*val   0: successful execution
!         1: x value out of bounds
!         2: y value out of bounds
!         3: z value out of bounds
!         4: q value out of bounds

!       405: x is not less than or equal to t(n+1)
!       406: a left limiting value cannot be obtained at t(k)
